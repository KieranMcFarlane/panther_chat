# üåç Global Sports Intelligence Database - Setup Guide

## Overview
The Global Sports Intelligence Database is now fully integrated into your Yellow Panther AI project. This system provides real-time opportunity tracking and stakeholder intelligence across 300+ sports organizations worldwide, with Premier League as the primary focus area.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd yellow-panther-ai
npm install
```

The package.json has been updated with all required dependencies including:
- Neo4j driver
- Radix UI components
- Lucide React icons
- Class variance authority for styling

### 2. Setup Neo4j Database

#### Option A: Local Neo4j Installation
1. Download and install Neo4j Desktop from https://neo4j.com/download/
2. Create a new database with these credentials:
   - Username: `neo4j`
   - Password: `your-password`
   - Port: `7687`

#### Option B: Neo4j AuraDB (Cloud)
1. Sign up at https://neo4j.com/cloud/aura/
2. Create a new AuraDB instance
3. Note the connection URI and credentials

### 3. Environment Configuration
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
# Neo4j Database Configuration
NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687
NEO4J_USERNAME=neo4j
NEO4J_PASSWORD=your-neo4j-password

# OpenAI Configuration (for GPT signal analysis)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key

# Development Environment
NODE_ENV=development
```

### 4. Initialize the Database
Run the setup script to create the Premier League Intelligence Graph:

```bash
npm run prem-intel:setup
```

This will create:
