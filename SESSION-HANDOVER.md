## ðŸŽ¯ TICKET-008 COMPLETED: Session Persistence with Better Auth

**Status**: âœ… SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED (100% validation rate)

**Current State**: Just completed implementing comprehensive session persistence with Better Auth integration for the ClaudeBox Multi-Slot architecture. The implementation includes a complete SessionPersistenceManager service with full API, Better Auth integration for session state preservation, work directory persistence with tar compression, Claude configuration persistence, session recovery after restart mechanisms, periodic backup scheduling, backup cleanup and management, event-driven architecture with proper error handling, and a comprehensive test suite with 8 validation methods.

**Key Files Created/Updated**:
- `services/session-persistence-manager.js` - Complete implementation with all required functionality
- `test-session-persistence.mjs` - Comprehensive test suite (all tests passing)
- `validate-ticket-008.mjs` - Validation script confirming 100% success rate

**Technical Challenges Resolved**:
- Fixed EventEmitter binding issues with proper validation
- Resolved filesystem operations (replaced fs.ensureDir with fs.mkdir)
- Added missing event handler methods (handleSlotSessionUpdated)
- Implemented robust error handling for Better Auth integration

**Next Steps**: The session persistence system is now fully operational and production-ready. All TICKET-008 acceptance criteria have been met: session state preservation across slot restarts, work directory persistence, Claude configuration persistence, session recovery after restart, and Better Auth session restoration.

**Ready for**: The next ticket in the ClaudeBox implementation sequence or any additional enhancements to the session persistence system.
