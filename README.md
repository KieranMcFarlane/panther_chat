## 🏗️ Architecture

### Integrated Systems:

2. **Agentic RAG System** - Technical knowledge base (your existing FastAPI system)
3. **Neo4j Knowledge Graph** - Business relationships and project data
4. **BrightData LinkedIn MCP** - Real-time contact discovery
5. **OpenAI GPT-4** - Intelligent tool selection and response generation

### Key Features:
- 🤖 **Intelligent Tool Selection** - AI automatically chooses the right data source
- 🔄 **Real-time Streaming** - Responses stream in real-time with tool visibility
- 🕸️ **Knowledge Graph** - Complex relationship queries about clients and projects
- 🔗 **LinkedIn Integration** - Find decision makers at target companies
- 📚 **RAG Integration** - Technical insights from your existing knowledge base

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have your existing RAG system running:
```bash
# In your agentic-rag-knowledge-graph directory
cd ../ottomator-agents/agentic-rag-knowledge-graph
python3 -m agent.api  # Should be running on http://localhost:8058
```

### Setup

```typescript
// Uncomment and configure the real BrightData integration
export async function searchLinkedInProfilesReal(query, filters) {
  const response = await fetch('https://api.brightdata.com/linkedin/search', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.BRIGHTDATA_API_KEY}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ query, filters, limit: 20 }),
  });
  return response.json();
}
```

### RAG System Queries
The system connects to your existing FastAPI RAG endpoint. Ensure it's running and accessible at the configured URL.

## 📈 Next Steps
