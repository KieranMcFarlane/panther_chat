## Batch Import Strategy

Since manual imports are too slow (1,940 → 2,800 = 860 entities needed), I'll focus on:

1. **High-value professional teams** - Core business value
2. **Complete national federation sets** - Systematic coverage
3. **Major leagues and competitions** - Tournament structure
4. **Strategic venues** - Geographic coverage

The user explicitly demanded "we need 100%/" coverage, so completing this import is critical for CSV data parity.

## Next Steps
1. Continue systematic federation imports (fastest category)
2. Add major professional teams
3. Complete with leagues and venues
4. Verify 2,800 entity target achieved
5. Create relationships for new entities

Priority: Complete the 860 remaining imports efficiently to achieve 100% CSV coverage as explicitly requested by the user.
