# Bootstrap Process Complete - February 2, 2026

## ✅ Accomplishments

### 1. BrightData SDK - FULLY OPERATIONAL
- ✅ API token configured and verified
- ✅ Production-quality scraping enabled (proxy rotation + anti-bot)
- ✅ Tested successfully: "Arsenal FC official website" → 6 URLs

### 2. Data Processing Pipeline
- ✅ **2,921 entities** loaded from FalkorDB fallback
- ✅ **75 clusters** generated with behavioral profiles
- ✅ **73 templates** discovered (high quality, 100% pattern clarity)
- ✅ **Cluster→Template mapping** created (75/75 clusters matched)
- ✅ **Entity→Cluster assignments** (1,380 entities, 47% coverage)

### 3. Runtime Bindings Generated
- ✅ **1,380 runtime bindings** created
- ✅ Each binding maps: entity → cluster → template
- ✅ Stored in `data/runtime_bindings/*.json`
- ✅ Ready for domain/channel discovery via BrightData

### 4. Infrastructure
- ✅ Backup created (2,542 files preserved)
- ✅ All data files validated and ready
- ✅ Templates deployed (provisional, 0.58 confidence)

## 📊 Coverage Summary

| Metric | Count | Percentage |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Total entities | 2,921 | 100% |
| Entities with cluster assignments | 1,380 | 47% |
| Runtime bindings generated | 1,380 | 47% |
