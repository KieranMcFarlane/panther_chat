I hope this message finds you well. I noticed [shared connection/interest] and wanted to reach out regarding [opportunity].

Our team at Yellow Panther has been working on [relevant work] and I believe there could be interesting synergies with your work at [their company].

Would you be open to a brief 15-minute call next week to explore potential opportunities?

Best regards`
