The requirement to 'create custom presentations' using 'internal business intelligence' suggests the use of data analytics or BI tools for sales enablement. Furthermore, the responsibility for 'overseeing complex rights packages' and 'negotiating long-form agreements' points to a mature contract lifecycle and vendor management process."
