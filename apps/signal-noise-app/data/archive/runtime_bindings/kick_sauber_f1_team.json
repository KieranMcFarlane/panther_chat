The focus on LATAM and specific payment systems suggests Libertex is building out regional infrastructure, which often involves procuring local payment gateway solutions, KYC verification services, and compliance tools. This reinforces the 'Sponsorship Technology Integration' pattern seen in previous iterations, showing the sponsor is scaling their technical capacity."
