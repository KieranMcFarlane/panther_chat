This indicates a reliance on digital education technology, likely requiring an LMS or vendor support. The '2025\u5e74\u5ea6\u5404\u7a2e\u767b\u9332' (2025 Annual Registration) signal suggests an active administrative cycle, potentially involving CRM or database management updates.

The partnership with Softbank 'NatureBank' shows a pattern of CSR/vendor collaboration."
