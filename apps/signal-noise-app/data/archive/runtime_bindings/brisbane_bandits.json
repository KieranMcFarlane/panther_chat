The reuse of 'Thirst Creative' (found in Iteration 1) suggests a league-wide partnership, reducing the likelihood of independent procurement by the Bandits for web design. The 'Buy Tickets' and 'ABL Shop' links indicate centralized e-commerce infrastructure managed by the ABL, meaning the Bandits likely consume these services rather than procure them independently."
