The specific visibility of 'Senior Vice President, People Business Partner' roles indicates a strategic pivot towards HR transformation and organizational restructuring, which often precedes or accompanies technology procurement changes (e.g., HCM systems). This confirms LPL is in a high-growth or restructuring phase."
