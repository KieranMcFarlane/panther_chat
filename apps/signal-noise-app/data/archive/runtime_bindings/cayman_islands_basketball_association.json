          "reasoning": "While the content does not reveal direct RFPs or technology stack details, it confirms active procurement of goods (uniforms) and services (coaching instruction) through sponsorship models. The partnership with 'Mourant' indicates a capability to secure external funding for specific league needs (uniforms), and the collaboration with the 'Department of Education Services' suggests a B2G (Business-to-Government) operational pattern. This signals a vendor-friendly environment but suggests a reliance on sponsorship rather than direct budget allocation for league supplies."
