While no explicit RFPs are visible, the reliance on web-based CRM and ticketing systems to manage season tickets (corporate and individual) and events indicates a functional need for these technologies. The presence of 'javascript:void(0)' links suggests a Single Page Application (SPA) architecture, likely built with a modern JS framework."
