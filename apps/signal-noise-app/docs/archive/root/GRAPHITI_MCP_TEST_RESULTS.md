# Graphiti MCP Server Test Results

**Date:** January 23, 2026
**Status:** ✅ Connected and Working

---

## Test Summary

### ✅ What's Working

**1. Graphiti MCP Server Connection**
- ✅ Successfully connects to production FalkorDB cloud
- ✅ SSL authentication working
- ✅ User/pass authentication successful
- ✅ Database: `sports_intelligence`
- ✅ Host: `<falkordb-cloud-host>:50743`

**2. MCP Tool Invocation**
- ✅ `mcp__graphiti__search_nodes` called correctly
- ✅ Tools respond with proper results
- ✅ Streaming responses work in browser

**3. System Architecture**
- ✅ CopilotKit API route properly configured
- ✅ Claude Agent SDK model cascade working (Haiku → Sonnet)
- ✅ Official Graphiti MCP tools available (9 tools)

### ⚠️ Issues Found & Fixed

**Issue 1: System Not Prioritizing Graph Tools**
- **Problem:** When asked "What do you know about Real Madrid?", the system used Claude's training data instead of checking the graph first
- **Root Cause:** System prompt not explicit enough about graph-first behavior
- **Fix Applied:** Updated system prompt with "CRITICAL: Always Check Graph First" section
- **Expected:** System now checks graph before using training data

**Issue 2: Empty Graph (Expected)**
- **Status:** Graph is empty (fresh production database)
- **This is expected:** Need to add data
- **Next Step:** Migrate existing sports entities or add new data

## Test Queries & Results

### Test 1: "Search for entities related to Real Madrid"

**Tools Called:**
- ✅ `mcp__graphiti__search_nodes`
- ✅ `mcp__graphiti__get_episodes`

**Result:**
```
✅ Tools called correctly
✅ Connected to production FalkorDB
✅ Returned: "graph is empty" (expected)
✅ Offered to add information (good behavior)
```

### Test 2: "What do you know about Real Madrid?"

**Tools Called:**
- ❌ No Graphiti tools called (PROBLEM)

**Result:**
```
❌ Used Claude training data instead of graph
❌ Did not check graph first
❌ Did not offer to add information to graph
```

**Fix Applied:**
Updated system prompt to enforce "Always check graph first" behavior

---

## Configuration Applied

### System Prompt Updates

**New Critical Section Added:**
```
**CRITICAL: Always Check Graph First**
Before answering any question about entities, relationships, or facts:
1. ALWAYS use mcp__graphiti__search_nodes to check if the entity exists in the graph
2. ALWAYS use mcp__graphiti__get_episodes to check for relevant information
3. ONLY if the graph is empty, offer to add the information using mcp__graphiti__add_memory

**Workflow:**
- Question → Check graph first → If found, use graph data → If empty, offer to add information
- NEVER use your training data without first checking the graph
- The graph is your PRIMARY source of truth, not your training data
```

---

## Next Steps

### 1. Test the Updated System Prompt ✅

**Query to test:**
```
What do you know about Real Madrid?
```

**Expected Behavior (After Fix):**
1. Claude calls `mcp__graphiti__search_nodes` for "Real Madrid"
2. Claude calls `mcp__graphiti__get_episodes` for Real Madrid
3. Graph returns empty (currently)
4. Claude offers: "The graph doesn't have information about Real Madrid yet. Would you like me to add it?"
5. If user says yes, Claude calls `mcp__graphiti__add_memory`

### 2. Add Real Madrid Data to Graph

**Option A: Through Chat Interface (Quick Test)**
- Tell Claude: "Add information about Real Madrid to the graph"
- Provide facts about:
  - Founded 1902, Madrid Spain
  - Santiago Bernabéu Stadium
  - 15 Champions League titles
  - Manager: Carlo Ancelotti
  - Players: Vinícius Jr, Jude Bellingham, etc.

**Option B: Script Migration (Production)**
- Create migration script to load existing sports entities
- Migrate from local database or API
- Bulk insert using `add_memory` tool

### 3. Load Production Data

**Current State:**
- Graph is empty (fresh database)
- Production FalkorDB cloud: Connected and ready
- Need to populate with 3,400+ sports entities

**Approach:**
1. Start with Real Madrid as test case
2. Add related entities (Barcelona, Manchester United, etc.)
3. Migrate full sports entity database
4. Verify queries work with real data
