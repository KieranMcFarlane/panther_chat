- **Connection Resilience**: Automatic reconnection with backoff strategy
- **Health Monitoring**: Periodic health checks with configurable intervals
- **Event-Driven**: Comprehensive event system for real-time monitoring
- **Configuration Flexibility**: Extensive configuration options with environment support

### Configuration Options
```javascript
{
  host: '13.60.60.50',              // SSH host
  port: 22,                        // SSH port
  keyPath: '/home/ec2-user/yellowpanther.pem', // SSH key path
  user: 'ec2-user',                // SSH user
  localPortRange: {                // Local port allocation range
    start: 9000,
    end: 9500
  },
  reconnectDelay: 5000,             // Delay between reconnection attempts
  maxReconnectAttempts: 10,        // Maximum reconnection attempts
  healthCheckInterval: 30000       // Health check interval
}
```

### Event System
- `initialized`: Service initialization completed
- `tunnelCreated`: New tunnel established
- `tunnelClosed`: Tunnel manually closed
- `tunnelDisconnected`: Tunnel disconnected unexpectedly
- `tunnelReconnected`: Tunnel successfully reconnected
- `tunnelHealthy`: Tunnel health check passed
- `tunnelUnhealthy`: Tunnel health check failed
- `tunnelError`: Tunnel error occurred
