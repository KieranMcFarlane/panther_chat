  revenuesPotential * 0.25 +             // 25% weight - business value
  technologyGaps * 10 * 0.25 +           // 25% weight - transformation needs  
  urgencyMultiplier * 0.2                // 20% weight - timing factors
)

// Digital Maturity Scoring (Applied)
linkedinScore = (
  followersScore(20) +     // >1000 followers
  websiteScore(20) +       // professional website
  employeesScore(20) +     // >10 employees on LinkedIn
