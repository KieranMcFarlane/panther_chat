## 🔧 Customization Options

### Adding More Queries
Edit `agents/cypherScripts/panther_knowledge_graph.cypher` to add more predefined queries.

### Modifying the Agent
You can customize the system prompt and add new categories of analysis.

### Example Custom Query
```cypher
CREATE (query4:Query {
    id: "club-relationships",
    name: "Club Relationship Analysis", 
    description: "Analyze relationships between clubs and their stakeholders",
    cypher: "MATCH (club:Club)-[:HAS_OWNER]->(owner:Owner) RETURN club.name, owner.name, club.league LIMIT 10",
    category: "Club Analysis"
})
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### If NeoConverse won't start:
1. Check Neo4j is running: `docker ps | grep neo4j`
2. Verify API key is set in `.env`
3. Run connection test: `./test-neo4j-connection.sh`

### If queries don't work:
1. Check your data schema matches the queries
2. Verify indexes are created in Neo4j
3. Test queries directly in Neo4j Browser
